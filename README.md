# How to... Implement Dark/Light Mode with React

## Motivation

Such a nice feature and in the same time a very difficult one, at least for a newbie in Reat.

I have found a lot of articles explaining different approaches to implement this feature, but non of them in a cooking-recipe way.

This article will try to describe every step in my way of understanding the process of implementing the Dark/Light mode in a simple React application.
